# Parkinson's Disease Background and Definitions

This is an Implemetation Guide for Parkinson's disease. It contains resources, profiles, and extensions for implementing the medical concepts associated with the parkinson's patients!

Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a neurodegenerative disease primarily of the central nervous system, affecting both motor and non-motor systems. Symptoms typically develop gradually, with non-motor issues becoming more prevalent as the disease progresses. Common motor symptoms include tremors, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and balance difficulties, collectively termed parkinsonism. In later stages, Parkinson's disease dementia, falls, and neuropsychiatric problems such as sleep abnormalities, psychosis, mood swings, or behavioral changes may arise.

Most cases of Parkinson's disease are sporadic, though contributing factors have been identified. 
Pathophysiology involves progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a midbrain region that provides dopamine to the basal ganglia, a system involved in voluntary motor control. The cause of this cell death is poorly understood but involves the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies within neurons. Other potential factors involve genetic and environmental influences, medications, lifestyle, and prior health conditions.

Diagnosis is primarily based on signs and symptoms, typically motor-related, identified through neurological examination. 
Medical imaging techniques like positron emission tomography can support the diagnosis. Parkinson's typically manifests in individuals over 60, with about one percent affected. In those younger than 50, it is termed "early-onset PD".

No cure for Parkinson's is known, and treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms. Initial treatment typically includes L-DOPA, MAO-B inhibitors, or dopamine agonists. As the disease progresses, these medications become less effective and may cause involuntary muscle movements. Diet and rehabilitation therapies can help improve symptoms. Deep brain stimulation is used to manage severe motor symptoms when drugs are ineffective. There is little evidence for treatments addressing non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and mood instability. Life expectancy for those with PD is near-normal but is decreased for early-onset.
